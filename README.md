Recursion Control Calculus: Prototype and Simulation Framework
Overview
This repository provides a formal implementation of the Recursion Control Calculus (RCC) framework for managing epistemic state evolution in AI systems exposed to stochastic perturbations. RCC introduces a calculus of recursion operators, cumulative misalignment control fields, dynamic rupture thresholds, and epistemic state reset mechanisms.

The implementation empirically validates the theoretical control properties derived from the RCC formal axiomatic system and corresponding meta-theorems.

The repository includes three principal simulation configurations:

Prototype Recursion Control Simulation (200 cycles)

Baseline Recursion System (500 cycles)

Stress-Test Recursion System (600 cycles)

Na√Øve Agent vs. RCC Agent Comparative Simulation (300 cycles)

Each simulation environment tests recursion system resilience under controlled and amplified volatility, confirming the RCC framework‚Äôs operational stability and control-theoretic guarantees.

Simulation Descriptions
Prototype Recursion Control Simulation
A 200-cycle demonstration of RCC recursion control dynamics under moderate epistemic volatility.
Key parameters:

Initial epistemic state: ùì•‚ÇÄ = 0.5

Reception perturbation: Gaussian N(0, 0.3¬≤)

Dynamic rupture threshold scaling by cumulative misalignment and Gaussian noise N(0, 0.025¬≤)

Recursion realignments are performed via a Continuity Monad operator when distortion Œî(t) ‚â§ Œò(t), with resets to baseline when ruptures occur.

Outputs:

Memory projection field evolution

Cumulative epistemic misalignment growth

Distortion and rupture event timeline
